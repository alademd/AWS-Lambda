# Amazon-Web-Services

This repo contains a couple of Lambda functions I wrote while learning about Amazon Web Services (AWS). I ran these functions  in the AWS cloud console, so they would need some additional package imports and perhaps some other setup to run elsewhere. 

DynamoDB-APIGW-Update is a simple Lambda function that acts as an HTTP endpoint to GET and POST to DynamoDB tables. To read my process and see a video demonstration, see my blog post: http://spencer-goff-dev.blogspot.com/2017/09/reading-from-and-modifying-dynamodb.html.

IoT-Button-SMS.py is a sample Lambda function that sends an SMS at click of an AWS IoT button. To read my process and see a video demonstration, see my blog post: http://spencer-goff-dev.blogspot.com/2017/09/aws-iot-button-2nd-gen-sending-sms.html
