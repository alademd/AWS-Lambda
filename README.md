# Amazon-Web-Services

This repo contains a couple of Lambda functions I wrote while learning about Amazon Web Services (AWS). I ran these functions  in the AWS cloud console, so they would need some additional package imports and perhaps some other setup to run elsewhere. 

DynamoDB-APIGW-Update is a simple Lambda function that acts as an HTTP endpoint to GET and POST to DynamoDB tables. 

IoT-Button-SMS.py is a sample Lambda function that sends an SMS at click of an AWS IoT button.
